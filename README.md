# Number-Conversion
## How It Works:

   - HTML Structure: The page consists of a dropdown menu to select the conversion type and an input field to enter the number.
   - CSS Styling: Basic styling for a clean and centered layout.
   - JavaScript Functionality: The convertNumber function handles the conversion logic based on the selected conversion type and updates the result dynamically.

## How to Use:

   - Copy the code above into a text file and save it with a .html extension, e.g., converter.html.
   - Open the file in a web browser.
   - Select the type of conversion you want to perform from the dropdown menu.
   - Enter the number you wish to convert in the input field.
   - The converted result will be displayed automatically.
